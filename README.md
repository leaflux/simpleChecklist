# More Info
simpleChecklist is a multiple page todo list app I designed in order to review Python and Django. Overall, my goals were to review 
what I'd already learned, but also to learn a bit more about Django from its documentation. Some features new to me included User 
objects, Choice Form fields, and the Model Meta option unique_together.

For the front end, I put most of my effort into making all my Templates consistent. Aside from HTML and CSS, I stuck with vanilla 
Javascript pretty strictly in order to concentrate on the back end. I used jQuery UI's datepicker, but nothing more convoluted 
than that.
